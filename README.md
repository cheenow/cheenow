## Projects

- **[Future-of-Pricing-in-Real-Estate](https://github.com/cheenow/Future-of-Pricing-in-Real-Estate)**
  - A data-driven analysis of real estate pricing trends using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
  - Insights:
    - Price Drivers: Waterfront presence, location (latitude & longitude), living area percentage, year built, and property grade are the most influential factors on house prices.
    - Model Takeaways: Linear Regression excels at predicting exact prices; KNN (k=10) is effective for classifying price levels but less accurate for precise dollar predictions.

- **[Canada Labour Market Dynamics (October 2025-2024)](https://github.com/cheenow/Labour-Market-Dynamics-in-Canada-2024-2025-.git)**
  - A data-driven analysis of Canada’s provincial labour market trends and employment opportunities using R and tidyverse.
  - Insights:
    - Provinces with strong population growth and falling unemployment (e.g., Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Saskatchewan) offer the best employment prospects.
    - Provinces with rising unemployment or declining employment rates (e.g., British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland & Labrador) may face labour market challenges.

- **[Canada Interest Rate Trends](https://github.com/cheenow/Canada-Interest-Rate-Trends.git)**
  - A data-driven analysis of Canadian interest rate patterns using R and tidyverse.
  - Insights:
    - Interest rates were low and stable in 2020–2021, then rose sharply in 2022–2023.
    - The Bank Rate most frequently recorded was 0.50%, persisting for 101 weeks, with rate changes occurring approximately every 103 days.
    
- **[SQL Fundamentals Project](https://github.com/cheenow/SQL-Fundamentals.git)**
  - A hands-on collection of SQL exercises focused on database creation, data insertion, querying, and relational modeling using MySQL.
  - Insights:
    - Gained experience designing and managing relational databases, including safe data insertion, validation, and handling missing values.
    - Applied essential SQL techniques—filtering, sorting, conditional logic, grouping, and aggregation—to support data analysis, reporting, and database management.
